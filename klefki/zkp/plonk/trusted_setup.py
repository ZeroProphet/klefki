# | # Choosing roots of unity
# | The BLS12-381 is chosen in part because it's FFT friendly. To use radix-2
# | FFT, we need to find m^th roots of unity, where m is a power of two, and
# | m is the degree bound of the polynomial we want to represent.
# |
# | In the BLS12-381, we can find primitive n^th roots of unity, for any
# | power of two n up to n <= 2^**32.
# | This follows because for the ssbls12-381 exponent field Fp, we have
# |    2^32 divides (p - 1).
